# Configuration file for obfuscating the user interface.

# Lines that start with a number sign (#) are comments.

# The following will change the name of Bibledit to Scriptedit:
# Bibledit=Scriptedit

# Obfuscating will take effect after removing the number sign, saving the file, and restarting Bibledit.

# Search and replace is case sensitive.

# Longer strings get replaced before shorter ones.

# More examples:
# bible=volume
# Bible=Volume
# Genesis=Startup
# Proverbs=Oneliners
