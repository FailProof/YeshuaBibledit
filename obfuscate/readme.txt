Installing an obfuscated version of Bibledit Cloud:
* Install Bibledit Cloud as usual.
* Follow the steps in obfuscate/sample.txt.


Creating and installing an obfuscated version of a Bibledit Linux client.

Follow the information at https://bibledit.org:8081/help/installlinux to install dependencies and get the stock Bibledit Linux client. There is one difference. The information says to run "sh install". This would install the program and icon with the name of "bibledit" in it. Instead, run "sh install noinstall".
